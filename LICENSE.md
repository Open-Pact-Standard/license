# Open-Pact License v1.1 (OPL-1.1)

## PREAMBLE

The Open-Pact License is designed for the age of AI and automated code extraction.
It guarantees source availability and individual freedom while establishing fair
compensation when code is taken for commercial profit or AI training.

Unlike traditional open source licenses written before the AI era, OPL-1.0
recognizes two fundamentally different modes of software consumption:
human use (reading, running, modifying) and machine use (training models,
extracting patterns, automated consumption). Both are addressed under this
license with appropriate terms.

This license is governed by the Guild -- the collective of contributors
registered in the project's on-chain royalty registry -- and is enforced
through both traditional copyright law and on-chain verification.

Contributor hereby grant to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce,
prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
sublicense, and distribute the Software and such Derivative Works in
Source or Object form, provided that such use is exclusively for
Personal Use as defined in Section 1.9.

### 2.2 Conditions
Personal use is granted freely. You must:
(a) Retain all copyright, patent, and trademark notices in the Software;
(b) Include a copy of this License in any redistribution of the Software;
(c) Include prominent notices stating that the Software is provided

Use (Section 1.9) or Internal Evaluation (Section 2.3), You are not
granted rights under Section 2 and must obtain an appropriate
Commercial License (Section 3) or AI Training License (Section 4).

---

## SECTION 3: TIER 2 -- COMMERCIAL USE LICENSE

### 3.1 Grant of License
Upon payment of the applicable license fee and registration with the
Guild's royalty registry, the Guild grants You a license to use,
reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly
perform, and distribute the Software for Commercial Use, subject to
the terms and conditions of this Section 3.

### 3.2 License Fee Schedule
License fees are set by the Guild and published in the on-chain guild
registry. Unless otherwise specified by the Guild, the following default
fee schedule applies on an annual basis:

| Tier        | Company Size           | Annual Fee    |

| Enterprise  | 1,000 or more employees | $50,000 USD  |

The Guild may adjust fee schedules through on-chain governance. Existing
licensees are subject to the fees in effect at the time of their
registration until renewal.

### 3.3 Payment and Registration
(a) Payment must be made through the Guild's royalty collection system
    using the accepted payment token(s) as published in the guild registry.
(b) Upon successful payment, You will receive a License Record in the
    Guild's on-chain royalty registry granting full Commercial Use rights
    for the license period of one (1) year from the date of payment,
    renewable upon re-registration.
(c) Self-attested information (e.g., employee count) must be provided
    in good faith and in accordance with reasonable commercial standards.
    Providing materially false information to obtain a lower tier fee
    constitutes a breach of this License and may result in termination
    under Section 10.

## SECTION 4: TIER 3 -- AI TRAINING USE LICENSE

### 4.1 Grant of License
Upon payment of the applicable AI Training license fee and registration
with the Guild's royalty registry, the Guild grants You a license to use
the Software, including its Source and Object forms, for the purpose of
training, fine-tuning, evaluating, or otherwise improving artificial
intelligence models, subject to the terms and conditions of this Section 4.

### 4.2 License Fee Schedule
Unless otherwise specified by the Guild, the following default fee
schedule applies on an annual basis for AI Training Use:

| Tier        | Organization Size       | Annual Fee    |

| Enterprise  | 1,000+ employees       | $100,000 USD  |

### 4.3 AI Training Disclosure Requirement
In addition to the requirements in Section 3.4, AI Training Licensees must:
(a) Disclose in the model card, documentation, or public notice for any
    AI model trained, fine-tuned, or improved using the Software that
    the Software was used in training. Such disclosure must include:
    (i) The name of the Software;
    (ii) The version or commit hash used;
    (iii) A link to the Software's repository;
(b) Ensure that any downstream users of the resulting model who receive
    code outputs substantially derived from the Software are notified that
    such outputs are subject to the same licensing conditions as the
    original Software;
(c) Not train AI models for the purpose of creating a product or service
    that competes with the Software or that replicates the core
    functionality of the Software using the Software's own code as training
    data, unless You hold both an AI Training License and a separate
    Commercial License covering such competitive use.

### 4.4 Acknowledgment
You acknowledge that:
(a) AI Training Use extracts compounding value from the Software that
    extends beyond the training period into all future outputs of the
    trained model;
(b) The AI Training License fee reflects this enhanced extraction value;
(c) Using the Software for AI Training without a valid License Record
    constitutes copyright infringement.

---

## SECTION 5: TIER 4 -- DERIVATIVE WORKS AND RECIPROCITY

### 5.1 Grant of License
Any Derivative Work of the Software must be licensed under the terms of
this Open-Pact License (or a later version of this License as provided
for in Section 12), and remains subject to the conditions of Sections 3,
4, and 5, as applicable to the Derivative Work's own use.

### 5.2 Royalty Reciprocity
If You distribute a Derivative Work of the Software and collect royalties
for that Derivative Work under this License:
(a) The Guild of the original Software must receive a proportional share
    of royalties generated by the Derivative Work, being no less than
    ten percent (10%) of Derivative Work royalties, unless the original
    Guild has approved a different percentage;
(b) Contributors to the Derivative Work's own Guild receive the remaining
    share;
(c) The split percentage between the original Guild and the Derivative
    Work's Guild must be published in both guilds' royalty registries
    and linked on-chain;
(d) This reciprocity requirement extends to subsequent Derivative Works
    (Derivative Works of Derivative Works), ensuring that original
    contributors continue to receive recognition and compensation through
    the chain of derivation.

### 5.3 Derivative Work License Records
The Derivative Work must establish its own royalty registry (or "Guild")
and must register its link to the original Software's Guild in the
on-chain registry. Failure to establish reciprocity while distributing
a Derivative Work constitutes copyright infringement of the original Work.

---

## SECTION 6: COPYRIGHT GRANT

### 6.1 From Contributors
Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor
hereby grants to You, through the Guild, a copyright license to
reproduce, modify, publicly display, publicly perform, and distribute
the Software and Derivative Works, subject to the tier-specific
conditions of Sections 2 through 5.

### 6.2 Limitation by Tier
The copyright grant is tier-specific. A license granted under Section 2
(Personal Use) does not confer rights under Sections 3, 4, or 5. A
license granted under Section 3 (Commercial Use) does not confer rights
under Section 4 (AI Training Use), and vice versa. You must hold all
applicable licenses required for Your intended use of the Software.

---

## SECTION 7: PATENT GRANT

### 7.1 From Contributors
Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor
hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
royalty-free license under any patent rights the Contributor holds that
are necessarily infringed by that Contributor's Contribution alone or
by combination of its Contribution with the Software, for purposes of
exercising the rights granted to You under the License tier applicable
to Your use.

### 7.2 Defensive Termination
If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Software
or a Contribution incorporated within the Software constitutes direct or
contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to
You under this License for that Software shall terminate as of the date
such litigation is filed, and Your License Record shall be subject to
termination under Section 10.

---

## SECTION 8: TRADEMARK

### 8.1 No Trademark Grant
This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks,
service marks, or product names of the Guild or any Contributor, except
as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of
the Software and reproducing the content of any required notices.

### 8.2 Proper Attribution
You must not use the name of the Guild, the Software, or any Contributor
to endorse or promote products or services derived from the Software
without prior written permission from the Guild, unless such use is
required to accurately describe the relationship between Your Derivative
Work and the original Software.

---

## SECTION 9: CONDITIONS AND REPRESENTATIONS

### 9.1 General Conditions
All tiers of this License are subject to the following conditions:
(a) The Software is provided under the terms of this License, and any
    reproduction or distribution must include a copy;
(b) All copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the
    Software must be retained in any copies;
(c) You represent that Your use of the Software falls within the scope
    of the License tier under which You claim rights.

### 9.2 License Record as Evidence
The Guild's on-chain royalty registry serves as the authoritative record
of who holds valid Commercial Licenses and AI Training Licenses. Absence
of a License Record for an entity engaged in Commercial Use or AI Training
Use constitutes prima facie evidence of unlicensed use for purposes of
any enforcement action.

---

## SECTION 10: TERMINATION

### 10.1 Automatic Termination
Your rights under this License terminate automatically if You fail to
comply with any term or condition of the applicable tier, including but
not limited to:
(a) Using the Software for Commercial Use without a valid, active
    License Record for the applicable tier;
(b) Using the Software for AI Training Use without a valid, active
    AI Training License Record;
(c) Failing to meet the disclosure requirements of Section 4.3;
(d) Providing materially false information during license registration;
(e) Distributing a Derivative Work without complying with Section 5.

### 10.2 Effect of Termination
Upon termination:
(a) All license rights granted to You under this License end
    immediately;
(b) You must cease all use, reproduction, and distribution of the
    Software;
(c) Termination of Your rights does not terminate the rights of
    others who have received the Software from You under valid licenses;
(d) Sections 7.2, 10.3, 11, 13, and 14 survive termination.

### 10.3 Reinstatement
If You cure the violation within thirty (30) days of first becoming
aware of it (by receiving notice from the Guild or through Your own
discovery), and You have not previously had rights terminated under
this License, Your License is reinstated prospectively as of the date
of cure. This reinstatement does not affect any claim for damages or
equitable relief accrued before cure.

---

## SECTION 11: ENFORCEMENT

### 11.1 Guild Enforcement Authority
The Guild acts as the collective rights holder for purposes of enforcing
this License. Enforcement actions may be initiated by a majority vote of
Guild Members through the Guild's governance mechanism.

### 11.2 Enforcement Mechanisms
The Guild may pursue enforcement through:
(a) Public notice of unlicensed use based on guild registry verification;
(b) Formal cease-and-desist communication with non-compliant users;
(c) Legal action for copyright infringement in the appropriate jurisdiction;
(d) Smart contract enforcement measures (e.g., access restrictions,
    royalty withholding) where technically feasible.

### 11.3 Personal Use Exception
This License expressly does not restrict the ability of any person or
entity to audit, review, analyze, or experiment with the Software for
security, research, or educational purposes. Such activities fall under
Personal Use (Section 2) and require no payment or registration.

---

## SECTION 12: VERSIONS AND UPDATES

### 12.1 License Versions

License, Your license and its grants, conditions, and obligations are
governed solely by the version of the License specified in Your License
Record (or by this version, for Personal Users).

### 12.3 Upgrading Existing Licenses
The Guild may offer to migrate existing License Records to a newer
version of the License. Licensees may accept or decline the upgrade.
Declining does not terminate existing rights.

---

## SECTION 13: DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY

### 13.1 NO WARRANTY
UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING, THE GUILD
PROVIDES THE SOFTWARE (AND EACH CONTRIBUTOR PROVIDES ITS CONTRIBUTIONS)
ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND,
EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES
OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR DETERMINING
THE APPROPRIATENESS OF USING OR REDISTRIBUTING THE SOFTWARE AND ASSUME
ANY RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR EXERCISE OF PERMISSIONS UNDER THIS
LICENSE.

NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW
(INCLUDING PRODUCT LIABILITY), SHALL ANY CONTRIBUTOR OR THE GUILD BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER ARISING FROM,
OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE, INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR
LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR
ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH
CONTRIBUTOR OR THE GUILD HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

---

## SECTION 15: MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

### 15.1 Governing Law
This License shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the jurisdiction in which the primary Guild registry is
deployed, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. If such
jurisdiction cannot be determined, the laws of the jurisdiction where
the majority of Guild Members reside shall apply.

### 15.2 Severability
If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable or invalid
by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall be modified
to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable and valid, and
the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.

### 15.3 No Waiver
Failure of the Guild or any Contributor to enforce any right or
provision of this License shall not constitute a waiver of that right
or provision, nor shall it affect the right to enforce such right or
provision in the future. No statement, promise, or agreement made by
an individual Guild Member or Contributor, unless formally ratified
by a vote of the Guild, shall create any exception to or modification
of the terms of this License.

### 15.4 Entire Agreement
This License, together with any applicable License Record, constitutes
the entire agreement between You and the Guild regarding the Software
and supersedes any prior or contemporaneous agreements, representations,
or communications relating to the Software.

### 15.5 Smart Contract Integration
Where this License references on-chain royalty registries, License
Records, guild governance, or automated royalty distribution, the
functioning of the applicable smart contracts constitutes an
integrated part of the License. In the event of a conflict between
the text of this License and the behavior of a smart contract, this
License text shall control and the Guild shall update the contract
accordingly.

### 15.6 Assignment
This License may not be assigned or transferred, in whole or in part,
without the prior written consent of the Guild, except that a License
Record for Commercial Use or AI Training Use may be transferred as
part of a merger, acquisition, or sale of substantially all assets of
the Licensee's business, provided that the transferee agrees to be
bound by the terms of this License.

---

## SECTION 16: STEWARDSHIP SUNSET (CHANGE PROTOCOL)

### 16.1 Purpose
This License is designed to ensure fair compensation while the Guild
actively maintains and governs the Software. To prevent the Software
from becoming "abandonware" with restrictive terms, this Section
defines a path to open source conversion.

### 16.2 The Conversion Trigger
If the Guild fails to update the Guild Registry (e.g., via a governance
vote, registry update, or version release) for a continuous period of
thirty-six (36) months ("The Sunset Period"), the restrictions in
Sections 3, 4, and 5 regarding the Software shall automatically lift,
and the Software shall be considered licensed under the terms of the
**Apache License, Version 2.0**.

### 16.3 Effect of Conversion
Upon conversion under Section 16.2:
(a) The Software is available under the Apache License, Version 2.0
    for all uses, including Commercial and AI Training Use, without
    fees or registration.
(b) This conversion is irrevocable.
(c) Previous License Records for Commercial or AI Training Use are
    honored as valid, but are no longer required.

### 16.4 Restarting the Clock
The Sunset Period is reset to zero if the Guild publishes a new version
of the Software or updates the Registry with a governance action
approved by Guild Members.

## SECTION 17: WHISTLEBLOWER PROGRAM AND BOUNTY FUND

### 17.1 The Whistleblower Fund
To facilitate enforcement of this License, the Guild shall maintain a Bounty Pool 
funded by a percentage (e.g., 5%) of all Royalty collections. This funds auditing, 
legal action, and rewards for reporting violations.

### 17.2 Reporting Violations
Any individual or Automated Agent may report a violation to the Guild. A valid 
report must provide evidence of: (a) Unauthorized Commercial Use; (b) Unauthorized 
AI Training Use; or (c) Failure to provide required disclosure.

### 17.3 Bounty Payouts
Upon verification of a reported violation, the Guild shall use the Bounty Pool 
to reward the reporter, calculated as a percentage of the recovered licensing 
fee or estimated damages.

### 17.4 Amnesty for Good Faith Errors
If a Licensee's error is found to be a minor administrative oversight 
(e.g., delayed renewal) and they cure the error within a 3-day window, 
no bounty shall be paid to the reporter.
